Ok, so here are the potential things we can examine

1. doing a benchmark time comparision of Theano vs Sympy symbolic differentiation
2. attempt to produce a meaningful(?) computational graph of some symbolic differentiation
3. ? 

I think 1 is the easiest, because the general framework has already been set up. All we need to do is run some more complicated derivatives, and 
figure out how to do time comparisions. Anyone opposed to that idea? 


Official tutorial to theano. It's relatively straightforward, but please message me if you have any questions
